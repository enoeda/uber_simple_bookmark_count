# Instapaper Count (a Chrome extension)

## Motivation
As you probably know, Instapaper does not show any badge or count of the unread items in your account. It's done on purpose and I'm aware of it, but I prefer to know if I have something pending in order to remember that I should go and read it.

So this plugin adds a button in the toolbar which shows the Instapaper item count.


## Installation

Open the [extension url](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/instapaper-count/oadfoocehndapcgpcbjngnnfonkilhjb) from Chrome and install it.


## Use
The first time, if you are not logged in at Instapaper it won't show any number but an '?'. 

Click on the button and it will open the Instapaper page so you can log in, and from now on, it will be able to retrieve the count (you can close the Instapaper tab whenever you want, it's not needed by the plugin to work).

Comments are welcome.
